# Templates

- Navigate to the template's directory.

```bash
  cd <template-name>
```

- Then read the `README.md` from the root directory for you to be able to run the template.

**Take note:**

- Although you may encounter an error when installing the packages related to husky, you can safely ignore it as this issue should not occur when the template is cloned to the user's machine.
