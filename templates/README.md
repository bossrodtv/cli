# Templates

- Navigate to the template's directory.

```bash
  cd <template-name>
```

- Then read the `README.md` from the root directory for you to be able to run the template.

**Take note:**

- You will encounter an error when installing the packages about the `husky` just ignore it because that will not happen when that template cloned to the user's machine.
